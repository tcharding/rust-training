Rust Training
=============

Algorithms and snippets to train Rust skills.

The purpose of this repository is to hold simple algorithms and snippets in Rust
that can be use for learning Rust.  The method involves writing out this code
daily during the learning process.  Keep writing each algo/snippet until one can
code it quickly without errors and without pausing to think.

Happy hacking

## Suggested order

The code is ordered by the way I wrote these drills (and by the way I learned
Rust).  You may like to follow the same order.

1. search
2. macros
3. combinators
4. sort
